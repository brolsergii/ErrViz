ErrViz
======

ErrViz is a tool for linguists which helps them to find and visualise the errors of automatic voice recognition systems. It uses STM (Refrences), CTM (Hypothesis) and WAV file formats as the input data.

This tool is developed as a project for LIUM (A lab at the University of Maine, Le Mans, France). If your are interested in this project you can participate by editing the code or by suggesting some possible functions.
